# Poetry

Python Poetry is a robust and efficient tool used for Python project dependency management. It aims to simplify the process of managing and packaging Python projects, ensuring consistent environments across different platforms. Poetry uses a declarative approach to manage dependencies, meaning you define what you need, and Poetry will handle the rest. It uses `pyproject.toml` file for configuration, replacing the traditional `setup.py`, `requirements.txt`, or `MANIFEST.in` files, making it a more streamlined and unified approach. Poetry can resolve and install dependencies with versioning, manage virtual environments, and publish packages to PyPI, making it a comprehensive solution for Python project management.

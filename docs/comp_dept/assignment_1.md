# Assignment 1: Markdown First Step

## Goals

- Write Markdown documents.
- Use Mermaid to draw diagrams.

## Q1: A Simple Project Usage Tutorial

Replicate content of these pages with Markdown. You don't need to replicate the whole page (i.e. sidebar, header and footer), just the content of the main part is enough. Don't forget the inline code blocks and the emphasized text.
